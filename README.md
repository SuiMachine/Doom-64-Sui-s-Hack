# Doom 64 Sui's Hack
A hack for DOOM 64, designed to restore **some** mouse look and various other things.

Current notes:
-------
* Mouse aim seems to work generally fine at the moment, but the logic for targetting is still as it was (not sure if this will be ever changed, mostly cause this project already ate too much of my time).
* "-file" still sets a cheat flag and a hack needs to be added
